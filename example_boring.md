Hello Technology of the Future!

My name is Paul Demchuk. 

This is a pretty plain looking document. But it is written markdown! So it is really easy to make it AWESOME

Some great things about markdown:

Easy to make lists
Even
Indented 
Lists
BOLD and
italics
are easy too!!!!

You can also write text like this (code blocks). It might not look useful, but its great if you want to show some code!


hello = "Hello World"
console.log hell

Hello World
 

Lets suppose you have a paper, or are writing a journal entry...

You would need a wicked title
And maybe an equally wicked sub-title

Then you would need a whole lot of text. But some text is more important than other text, so it should be highlighted. And some text links to other places on the internet, such as http://www.github.com. That is enough of that. I am just going to add some filler so you can see how easy it is to make something pretty.

Hit me with some hipster

Conclusion

That is the end of markdown. It is so easy, and so fast to write neat looking documents. You can just write the EXACT SAME WAY, and then look online to find a template....and there are a lot

The best part is that you can export it as HTML, so you can just slap it in your blog or website if you have one!!

If you want to give it a try, here is an interactive editor, with a list of the commands on the right!
